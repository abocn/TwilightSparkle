Twilight is a a simple Telegram bot made in Node.js made for giving information about the MLP G4 animated series, comics and characters.
 - You can find Twilight at [@MissTwilightSparkleBot](https://t.me/MissTwilightSparkleBot) on Telegram.

## Self-host requirements
 - Node.js 23 or newer (you can also use Bun)
 - A Telegram bot (create one at [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather))
 - Latest version of Node.js

## Run it yourself, develop or contribute with Twilight
First, clone the repo with Git:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ABOCN/TwilightSparkle
```
Next, inside the repository directory, create a `config.env` file with some content, which you can see the [example .env file](config.env.example) to fill info with.

After editing the file, save all changes and run the bot with ``npm start``.
- To deal with dependencies, just run ``npm install`` or ``npm i`` at any moment to install all of them.

## Note
- Take care of your ``config.env`` file, as it is so much important and needs to be secret (like your passwords), as anyone can do whatever they want to the bot with this token!
